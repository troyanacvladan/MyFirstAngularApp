<h2>Shipping Costs</h2>

<!--
This template displays the shipping types and prices using the 'async pipe'.
The async pipe subscribes to something and returns the latest value from a stream of data and continues
to do so for the life of a given component. When Angular destroys that component, the async pipe automatically stops
(unsubscribes automatically to avoid potential memory leaks).
For detailed information about the async pipe, see https://angular.io/api/common/AsyncPipe.
